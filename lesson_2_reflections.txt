What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, a new hidden directory is createed with
the name .git, which contains the metadata associated with the repository.
We need it so as to be able to track changes in the files contained in the
repository, which is the whole point of using version control systems.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from the working directory and repository in the
fact that staging area contains only those files whose changes are to be
tracked among all the files in the working directory. Repository contains
commits, that is, a copy of files to be tracked at a particular time.
